- Support vector Machines
- Feature scalling
- One vs all method in logit classification
- Backprop algorithm
- Normalization and feature scaling
- Precision/Recall
- Linear Algebra
- Derivation of the SVD 
   - what is the covariance
- Stochastic gradient descent
- Online learning algorithms ( click through rate)

## Ideas
Is it possible to use Anomaly detection to identify strange move in the price of a stock.
Is it possible to determine the distribution of the parameter by ploting the data.
Is it possible to use PCA to get independent features to do anomaly detection, this because anomaly detection requires that the variable are independent.
