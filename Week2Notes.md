# Feature scaling

Feature scaling allows gradient descent to converge more quickly, it consist of dividing each feature by the max value among the features.

Another method to do feature scaling is what is called mean normalization, in this case substract each value from the mean of the feature and divide by the (max -min)  value or the standard deviation of that feature.
